Players to watch in the upcoming session

  <ol>
    <li><strong> Erling Haaland </strong> - Enter the goal machine. After only 4 matches, Haaland leads the way in the race for the golden boot. A high scoring Man City with an injury free Haaland is to be feared. </li>
    <li><strong> Kevin De Bruyne </strong> - A semi-fit KDB finished in last year's top 10 points scorers. The possibilities are endless for a fully fit and firing KDB. The one reservation and consideration is whether Man City will continue with a false nine now that they have one of the world's best no. 9s in Haaland. This may lower KDBs scoring potential. Even with that, he still makes the list. </li>
    <li><strong> Harry Kane </strong> - The striker that doesn't score in August or does he? Off to a bright start having already 4 in 4 only bodes well in year that Harry will want to be in form going into the World Cup. </li>
    <li><strong> Alexander Mitrovic</strong> - The surprise inclusion but after breaking all previous Championship records last season, I expect good things from Mitrovic this season. Mitrovic is likely to deliver well on points per mil ratio. </li>
    <li><strong> Mo Salah </strong> - Last season's highest scoring player is impossible to look past. Not only a consistent points scorer but an incredibly reliable captain. A MUST-HAVE player! </li>
  </ol>

</p>

<p> A high scoring and attacking minded fabulous five to fill up your line-up. 
  
Check back in a week when I'll expand the site to include the Top 5 defending options for your team in 2022/23.
